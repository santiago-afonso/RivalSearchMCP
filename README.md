# RivalSearchMCP

Advanced MCP server for web research, content discovery, and trends analysis.

## Origin & fork status

This repository (`santiago-afonso/RivalSearchMCP`) is a personal fork of the
original project [`damionrashford/RivalSearchMCP`](https://github.com/damionrashford/RivalSearchMCP).
The goal of this fork is to track upstream while experimenting with local
improvements and stdio-focused tooling for MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor,
VS Code/Continue, etc.).

## What it does

RivalSearchMCP provides comprehensive tools for accessing web content, performing multi-engine searches, analyzing websites, conducting research workflows, and analyzing trends data. It includes 6 core tool categories for comprehensive web research capabilities.

## Why it's useful

- Access web content and perform searches with anti-detection measures
- Analyze website content and structure with intelligent crawling
- Conduct end-to-end research workflows with progress tracking
- Analyze trends data with comprehensive export options
- Generate LLMs.txt documentation files for websites
- Integrate with AI assistants for enhanced web research

## How to get started

### Connect to Live Server

Add this configuration to your MCP client:

**For Cursor:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "RivalSearchMCP": {
      "url": "https://RivalSearchMCP.fastmcp.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop:**
- Go to Settings → Add Remote Server
- Enter URL: `https://RivalSearchMCP.fastmcp.app/mcp`

**For VS Code:**
- Add the above JSON to your `.vscode/mcp.json` file

**For Claude Code:**
- Use the built-in MCP management: `claude mcp add RivalSearchMCP --url https://RivalSearchMCP.fastmcp.app/mcp`

- **Data Export**: Multiple format support (CSV, JSON, SQL) for trends data
- **Intelligent Crawling**: Smart website traversal with configurable depth and modes

## Changes in this fork vs upstream

On top of the upstream `main` branch, this fork currently includes a small
number of local changes tailored for stdio usage and easier local testing:

- **Stdio‑friendly server startup** – middleware and custom HTTP routes are only
  registered when `ENVIRONMENT=production`, so stdio mode runs without HTTP
  middleware that expects an HTTP context.
- **Safer rate limiting middleware** – the rate limiting middleware now guards
  access to `fastmcp_context.client_id`, avoiding attribute errors when the
  context is missing or partial.
- **HTTP client configuration tweaks** – `fastmcp>=2.0.0` is explicitly added to
  `requirements.txt`, and the shared `httpx.AsyncClient` is configured with
  `verify=False` to work around SSL certificate issues in constrained
  environments.
- **Multi‑engine search metadata** – when Bing is the primary engine, the
  multi‑search summary now includes a `successful_engines` count in the
  metadata, making it easier for clients to understand how many engines
  returned usable results.
- **Local testing & setup helpers** – local helper files such as
  `QUICKSTART.md`, `MCP_CONFIG.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, and simple stdio test scripts
  (`test_stdio.py`, `test_google_search.py`) are provided to make it easier to
  verify the server locally and to document the stdio configuration.
